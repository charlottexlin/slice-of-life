# Slice of Life ðŸŒ±
Welcome to Slice of Life! This is my submission for the health track of HackNYU 2022.
Slice of Life is a time slice tracking desktop app, designed to inspire a healthier lifestyle.
Users can navigate between the "today" page and the "goals" page. On the "goals" page, you can
set goals for your ideal day by splitting up a pie chart of 24 hours into 8 categories:
fitness, study, work, sleep, self care, hobbies, social, and chores. Here you can also check
in with your goals to get a recommendation on how you're budgeting your time. On the "today"
page, you can enter a slice to indicate what you've done so far today. You can also check in
with your daily slices, and see how they compare to your goals. This app can help people
manage their time better and make sure they fit in all the important things they should do
each day to maintain good health.

All the code and artwork is done by me. I used Java, Swing library for GUI, Eclipse IDE, and
Procreate. There's still a lot I would've liked to add to Slice of Life, but I did it all in
a day, so I'm pretty proud of it :)

# Instructions to download
You can try it out for yourself by downloading the file called "Slice of Life.jar" from this
repository. You do not need to download any of the other files to run the program. You may
have to change some settings on your computer to allow it to run, depending on your OS.
In general, single-clicking the download or double-clicking the .jar file wherever you saved
it should launch the program.
