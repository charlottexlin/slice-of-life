# slice-of-life
Welcome to Slice of Life! This is my submission for the health track of NYUHacks 2022.
Slice of Life is a time slice tracking desktop app, designed to inspire a healthier lifestyle.
Users can navigate between the "today" page and the "goals" page. On the "goals" page, you can
set goals for your ideal day by splitting up a pie chart of 24 hours into 8 categories:
fitness, study, work, sleep, self care, hobbies, social, and chores. Here you can also check
in with your goals to get a recommendation on how you're budgeting your time. On the "today"
page, you can enter a slice to indicate what you've done so far today. You can also check in
with your daily slices, and see how they compare to your goals. This app can help people
manage their time better and make sure they fit in all the important things they should do
each day to maintain good health.

There's still a lot I would've liked to add to Slice of Life, but I did it all in a day, so
I'm pretty proud of it anyway :)
